# Digitalized-Water-Meter
*By WM Chamudini, DJN Dissanayaka, ML Yushri Ahmed*

A Digitalized Water Meter project uses sensors and microcontrollers to track water usage in real time, sending data to a server or cloud platform for monitoring via a web or mobile dashboard. It helps with conservation, and usage analysis.

It often includes components like:
   1. Microcontroller (ESP32) to read data from a flow sensor
   2. Wi-Fi module to transmit data
   3. Thingspeak to store and visualize water consumption
   4. Mobile dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerts
